story

man become illcould hardly move lay
loved married spent
waking hour thinking could persuaded
telephone installed brought bedside
could talk could talk others every night
rang long conversation many time day
also nothing happened could saved life
modern device lightened last week

death although blasted hope made difference
devotion merely installed memory place rich
personality loved almost ever
standard would liked would
disliked left undone although dead swayed utterly
dominion equable gentle although broken
heart took thing came since could anything
matter everything mattered

one perplexity power trouble
wonder amazement horror much knowledge
kindliness sympathy made world good
happiness wantonly extinguished touch
vanished hand permitted one soul left
behind soul fused could neither
understand forgive religious never ordinary
sense although religion must sway true idealistic lover
broke even slender tie held
orthodoxy threw creed parent
naturally simply borrowed garment sank
sorrow also solace without another thought
hereafter

went year time house
remained empty save caretakerfor rich could
bear anyone else live thereand room exactly

spanton seems much earnesta boyish figure
twentysix clean shaven without soft brown clothes costly
jaegerisms external insignia kind
contrary bit dandy us quite superlative soap
manicure set said nothing annoying
agreed one indulging mood
selfdepreciation well spanton never annoyed way

theyre foolish lot said referring company
dabneys go every week cackle none
ever life except possibly blackguard rudsonwayte
ought gaol whole world like
friend acquaintance either writing talking

seems said scheme might go farther
enormously beneficial result know understand

understand cook difficulty cook diningroom
would know first time felt like dish
cold underdone late bond would thus grow

spanton pleased say amendment sensible

chapter xii

firstfloorfront unfolds secret
remarkable industry laid bare

mr lacey introduced mr furley divide
first floor hear moving restlessly overhead
hour mentioning habit said always
walked inventing asked inventing said
film story mr furley make picture real event
staple odd business devise drama
bought estate near london essex walled garden
fine tree plentiful cheap
erected huge crystal palace indoor photography well
natural surroundings openair episode
formed stock company actor actress perform play

mr furley sent message one fine morning say
drama making day would like see said
would soon dashing suburb motorcar

turned gateway estate among tree
red indian encampment number tethered horsesonly
yard busy high street electric tram cowboy
pony waited near excited manager shouting
megaphone camera clicked myriad impression
whole effect strangely bizarre must admit struck
desperately silly least seemed desperately silly
day time thousand countryman england
later thousand people rest world going
pay feeling worked cynically
manufactured heroic

idea said cowboy drama made
england

bless heart said mr furley nearly everything
done england background tree essex enough like
background tree texas satisfy people
movement humanity look dont criticize
matter fact cinema wont let themits hypnotic
lull

cowboy done scene cardboard room quickly
erected unhappy heroine sat receive visit
drunken lover reclaim whisky
three wall two side one set obtuse angle
back

wouldnt think see thing screen said
mr furley fourth wall world
camera midst build three wall open air
part keep actor focus mean long
strip wood ground mustnt step
ready take rehearsing long
time word notice spoken time would
wrong action wouldnt fit dont ask learn
anything heart merely get sense actor need ever
retire private life memory voice
gone cinema employ

there nothing cant cinema said
instance suppose want show run steamroller
could thoroughly make wife shriek first
place roller advance take
photograph roller touch stop camera
lay floor dummy figure take roller advancing
stop camera place floor brownpaper
shape like pressedout man take roller passing
lot people crowd stop take
place ground middle turn
wheel see restored life picture
exhibited run straight break
break art leaving camera
good anything new idea want

another thing want english actor actress sense
gesture idiot stand deliver speech
post suppose come
film result get foreigner best
playsitalians first allbecause move hand
speaking convey meaning actor
certain thing right best emotional thing
result im writing series purely english play
english stolidity needed theyll home

mr furley showed trick film made
example one box brick opened automatically
brick came built house unbuilt
returned box

single picture principle said one picture
time theyre reeled taken continuously
like view opening parliament forth suppose
box brick want brick come
stand end take piece thread fine
invisible fasten brick lift
brick infinitesimal way photographed little
another photograph little another
perhaps brick end sixty separate picture
made others film may take five
minute exhibit required two week tenhour day
make

historical scene still popular place said
careful public doesnt want
exact exact way always thought
instance wanted execution mary queen scot
went british museum see contemporary picture
think could use bit public accustomed
think mary seen many modern painting
wouldnt stood went modern painter instead
got good idea isnt real thing execution
always popular woman like sad storyjane shore amy
robsart prince tower charles firstyou cant go
wrong

matter fact hold whatever give public
theyve got cinema habit film change
every monday thursday hall well every monday
every thursday see people roll good set
tell friend good perhaps come
bad set say nothing hope better luck next
time one thing cant stay away cinema got


looked strange place heard mr furleys
explanation idea possibility cinema
crowded mind educational advantage example
remarkable day certainly come school
machine exhibiting film delicate physiological
process recorded evolution butterfly
egg hatching chicken forthall making biology
lesson fascinating romance every science fact
humanized invention school child actually see
world act growing particular hobby
toofolk dancinghow easily cinema could help
reproducing step movement exactly make teacher
almost unnecessary

geography againhow vastly entertaining lesson would
scholar taken short trip country
examination london early day cinema
several hall scenery shown
popular today taste declined everyone want melodrama
old topographical film lost would
priceless quickening imagination young school

made suggestion mr furley
enthusiastic serious man taste let
interfere business trade said must
give public want people like come say
dont raise tone film make
instructive want retire order must
make money used notion would ahead
time ive given fact cinema manager
buy film wont let decide public want
public want decide im sure
whichever there chance much isnt vulgar
real event landscape film everything
either passionate comic

well said time must surely come soon cinema
begin need brain sham stuff fatigue
real thing chance take advice try
van feel sure london could stand one
hall rate something better given
possibility satire example never ally think
deadly political meeting could film depicted
rival candidate ridiculous situation think socialism
might gain series view stately home england
idle plutocratic owner play think way
cinema could fortify supplement work illustrated
paper beginning absurd
talk retiring yet every ten camera film make
satisfy stupid public ought make one good one
conscience sake

mr furley laughed dont know ignorant buyer
deal said

open theatre urged

anything replied want get
getting nerve cant sleep eye turned
lens brain camera see everything like
nothing farming good want get farm
soon stop im talking peopleas
might nowi find ready swear
animated search paper death king
there nothing popular royal funeral im lost
soul

one gone matter notion
industry sprung around cinema first
photographer must supplied material least
annually many mile celluloid film film
made factory came nothing make
passing photographic accessory come
building drama enacted actor perform
costume horse motorcar scenery require
manager rehearse themoften day day hour
minute occupied final photography development
reproduction film sale various syndicate
control cinema show world exhibition
theatre day long three day
delectation thousand spectator whole thing
isnt fourteen year old

made remark effect

oh said mr furley cinema industry nothing compared
america take seriously expensive actor
actress retained large tract country rented
activity prodigious italy france pay immense
salary funny men huge fee dramatist devise
scenario pay next nothing possible nothing
one get plot want head old
novelette man always work reading old novelette
plot

government servant father young girl going
marry racing habitué sort case

well come said sort case one ever
prosecution talking personally always agree
censor although dimly conscious
another side casemineif could made articulate
considering question young
heathcote going marry

havent notion said sir gaston know
later rather sooner daughter call
good timeby course mean irresponsible one
enough instinct good feeling realize
married irresponsibility cease enough emotional
dependence impatient marriage heathcote seems
precisely similar temperament hence look upon two
enviable creature living sit watch
superficial joke superficial wrangling
frivolous planmakings morrow consider

really exceedingly sensible need shocksuch
standing altar step best clothes really
serious person surplice saying really serious thingsto steady
life ann already shown capacity work
routine learned typing thoroughly office

adopt regular habit come home lunch likely keep
account harmless form wild oat sowing
dont fear least much alarmed
always embracing whenever walked took arm
hastening wedding fear
flame might die quickly trouble follow
twotheyre right public contempt

cant find much real satisfaction daughter alison
completely lost except letter husband

suspected thing give sermon address
danger new cult diversion deprives character
intensity leave draw right moral im

level liked better say silly young as
deserve lose taking loving
instead playing dictator unsexing best
thing world pretty affectionate girl true nature
silliest thing pretty affectionate girl pretending
something

either speech might made instead sympathized
advised wait little longer confessing
complete failure

said attitude final dont feel could
reopen matter laughing sister

liked hear human note

begin course shant marry thats end
woman

word ironical god must tired
hearing strode away

perplexity person seriously one somehow
feeling one wedding last

spanton admit way blame
nancy still ardent futurist unshaken anything

much belief yet none less motor bus
day bowling hampstead road like avalanche saw
wistful expression come face watched two lover
seat front u quite common superior point
view shop assistant clerk clerk shop
assistant engagement ring pearl surrounded
five little turquoise near possible
one happiness word caught
lull racket made terrible vehicle

wistful look

wondering whether learnt anything
happened course many u learn badly
spanton lacking humility seedoflearnings
fruitful soil nancy made mistake feel
convinced bitterness fortunate
one hardest thing life woman
failing make one woman happy many man acquires
experience serve succeeding another

story stormy voyage life water reached

two pretty maid arrived one take away tea
little girl mr harberton suggested
go see warden said slight smile
made invitation pleasant joined mr harberton
thought trollope head vision whitehaired
president college judge surprise little
shy woman met u far gate introduced miss
mitt warden pink almshouses anticipated
wrongly instead rosetinted building word
led expect found beautiful edifice grey stone
long warmlytiled roof founder mr pink
friend mr harberton

beautiful almshouses england someone ought
write book describing especially almshouse architecture
almost best indigenous domestic architecture
temptation beset modern architect build private house
seem part absent build almshouses
another triumph humility perhaps time even
ambitious designer remembering purpose building
forced simple

amusing almshouse know chichester one
great dark red roof pretty dormer dwell several old
lady apartment like undergraduate nun
nurse one end central passage chapel
like usual plan betterthe row tiny
domicile like terrace fairy godmother little garden
muslin blind evidence security
building young architect soft flannel collar
guess put mr harberton mr pink legacy

mr pink almshouses would desired long
low façade two wing right angle flagged garden
intervening space quite suggestion harbour refuge
harm using old material architect
prevented appearance crudity creeper already high
wall thirteen little house long roof
three wing seven main building
warden house middle one twelve old woman
either spinster widow fiftyfive make
faintest difference whether ever
receipt parish relief ten shilling week light
coal allowance find meal dress
respect often little helped friend
relation

anyone meeting miss mitt london say would guess
warden twelve pernickety old woman unlikely
london seldom never estimate provincial true
worth small unobtrusive
abode authority doubt though still small
unobtrusive wore brow sign manual
responsibility control long talk
duty difficulty

love work said easy im
complaining know dont think thing ought easy

ever asked

oh dont know said ive always feeling ever
since child

course poor little nonconformist shall say poor
little anglosaxon

lotuseating would give terrible stomachache said
wouldnt

plucky little creature hardihood reply hope


people like england full
suspicion happiness blood

tell old pest said

oh mr falconer replied theyre old pest theyre
dear old people troublesome
way really believe worst jealousy make
difficult quite open hate
show little attention one another im sure hear
notice effect

ah jealousy said thats real blot mankind know
origin course good god first made man
remember extracted woman man side much
occupied gazing new work hand suddenly thought
created forgot aperture closed
could close little poisonous reptile crept
ever since human blood free look
much cain inherited

oh dear terrible said miss mitt really true
clicked tongue well there plenty
ordinary tantrum ailment
grumbling hard keep away nicer
one others cant bear thing
surreptitiously

asked worse single married woman
forced give palm single suppose
said married one married
thereforetherefore loss

helped therefore said inured trouble
vexation

yes miss mitt agreed dont mind thinking

men nuisance arent said

oh dear didnt mean exactly exactly said little
warden meant married woman understand
giveandtake better others lived alone
mustnt think single one cross widow
always good tempered isnt one exampleand
knocked dooris sweetest spinster could wish
meet name selina still isnt pretty

miss still let u ina little grey woman room marvel
radiant precision mr falconer come london way
motorcar said miss mitt

frightened go one indeed could selina still
motorcar would sin nature

others joined u farrar laughed notion fear

oh said miss still solemnly think flying dreadful
dont believe going last cant help feeling
there one wont much longer brook thing getting
near

miss still expressed wish see london expect
last lady maid two
prized recollection crystal palace spurgeons

next selina still lived gipsy wood must longago
youth beauty mother named gipsy
black eye nearing eighty rheumatic

long kept roof head nothing else matter
always told child twin
fiftyone brought husband disappeared
child dropped away year ago go
hospital leg bad came
people house room vanished
thing almshouses would
union

quite typical story illustrating wife
dogged courage husband unthrift also uselessness
many child would seem indeed exception rather
rule find son daughter poor growing
help parent poverty hard put provide
springboard take better position

apropos twin another old lady otherwise
interesting mournful body black pink cotton wool
ear gave head appearance seen hurriedly
hollow boasted two couple twin twice
work exact use word twin eight
birth sixteen meant four
altogether congratulated achievement
apathetic mr nottidge said wife
landlord jolly bricklayer triplet got queen
bounty heroine twin warden told u liked keep
bottle gin always referred tactfully medicine
supplied neighbouring lady sent pound
tea basket gin bottle breaking tea
saturated ordinary person would merely deplored loss
recipient resourceful dried tea oven
found vastly improved drenching old woman like
drop something strong teacup know
possibly idea tea trade might enormously increase
profit consuming gin normal manner miss
mitt told u old lady always stirred sprig rue
made healthier

martha drax mr drax nearing seventy
time could spare household duty devoted
meditating upon letter king exactly
madalthough occupation might suggest itbut little
enfeebled intellect indeed poor old woman every right
considering go long life
penury struggle case enough
reason marthas story

girl service become engaged son local
baker gone well took day holiday visit
seaside resort became wholly dangerously intoxicated
terrified broke match
could win vain year married
another girl place big strong creature cook
doctor lived village man worked
gardener attended chapel martha also
remained although eager get away tethered
epileptic brother bedridden mother
wait last dislike seeing man wife together
told upon left chapel began go church man
avoided exchanging time day
met though jealous wife intensely
resented

thing went sixteen year last able
leave village take service neighbouring town cease
reminded man existence

one evening two year knock back door
went wife dead six month
lonely unhappy never really loved anyone
martha would marry partly suddenness
shock partly feeling finger fate
little pleasurable excitement pride think
power exerted partly word seemed
natural like die married woman consented
thought quote coming back
year saying never wanted anybody else took breath
away made impossible say

anyway married discover

therefore allowed parcel remain among papersevery night

missing picture brought parcel cloakroom
attendant knowledge busy say take
particular notice people fancy elderly woman

picture subjected careful scrutiny
found perfect condition question
copy may set aside nation congratulated
recovery treasure doubt certain line investigation
followed likely trustee wish
devote large portion exiguous income
inquiry could afford certain sentimental
satisfaction may take restitution sufficiently
indicates remorse thief let question
punishment go

picture may add came possession nation
bequest wealthy merchant connoisseur named james
murchison committed suicide voyage america shortly
leaving queenstown james murchison
